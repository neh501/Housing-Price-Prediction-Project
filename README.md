This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning models. It explores different regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Trees, to evaluate their performance in predicting prices based on features like location, size, and amenities. The project uses Python and popular libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
